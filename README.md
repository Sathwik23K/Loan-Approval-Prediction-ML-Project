# Loan-Approval-Prediction-ML-Project
Loan approval is one of the most important decisions in the financial sector.
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details.
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and optimizationâ€”skills essential for data science and ML roles.
