# Loan-Approval-Prediction-ML-Project
Loan approval is one of the most important decisions in the financial sector.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and optimizationâ€”skills essential for data science and ML roles.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing of loan application dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns.

Implementation of multiple classification algorithms:

â†’ Logistic Regression

â†’ Decision Tree Classifier

â†’ Random Forest Classifier

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.

Deployment-ready ML pipeline in Python.
